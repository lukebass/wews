# Forecasting Wildfires in British Columbia

## Introduction

With trends set in motion by Climate Change, wildfires are becoming an increasingly devastating force for populations around the world. In some regions, such as California in the United States, they are a leading cause of property loss, habitat destruction, and GHG emissions. In the 2020 fire season, wildfires in California caused over 12 Billion USD in damages. There is a high demand for prediction capabilities in regions such as this. Even small predictive ability on the order of minutes or hours could avert billions in damages by allowing first responders the ability to mitigate blazes before they spread, erect preventative measures, mobilize resources proactively to blaze sites, and begin evacuation efforts before residents are in peril. This project attempts to predict and forecast wildfires, using machine learning classifier algorithms, in British Columbia.

## Data
